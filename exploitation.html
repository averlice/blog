O wait, there isn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re both free. NVDA is even open source, if you want an open source option/alternative to narrator, but let&rsquo;s press on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Additionally, there is a perpetual license. This would be the preference, but there is a problem we must discuss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the perpetual licensing, it mentions something known as a </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://store.freedomscientific.com/collections/software-for-home/products/jaws-home-edition-screen-reading-software&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756005772164925&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ybfMQxcjexjL_UlQwCNpl">software maintenance agreement (SMA)</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quoting from the horses mouth:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c9 c12">To ensure the ability to use your computer with the continuous updates of Windows, Office&reg;, your browser, and other applications, your purchase includes a Software Maintenance Agreement (SMA). An SMA ensures you are protected now and in the future, as it includes the next two years of JAWS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c9">SMAs are activated on the date of purchase.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c9 c13">SMAs are </span><span class="c7">tracked by term (e.g., 24 months)</span><span class="c9 c13">&nbsp;from activation, no longer tied to a product version.</span><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A SMA basically forces you to pay more than you already paid for software you already licensed, ahem, sorry, I mean,bought, ahem, sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Something in my throat&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The problem is you already have the software. You paid the onetime fee. And yet they&rsquo;re making it more expensive on you, the user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re probably thinking long term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you are, you might wanna get a perpetual license. But what good is it when you are literally paying for a, let&rsquo;s call it what it is, subscription, that &nbsp;you didn&rsquo;t wanna pay for in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the people I&#39;ve noticed people trying to make is that they have features. They need to sustain themselves. They have scripts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sustaining yourself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First off, I&#39;ve seen businesses sustain themselves, while charging far less money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, I worked in one before. It didn&rsquo;t have much money but maybe a few thousand, and it was still able to sustain itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, it did very well, and earned more money each day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for NVDA, NVDA literally delivers it free of charge. They primarily go from donations, and corporate IT help and support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, on the page linked above for nvda, you can literally go to it, and you can donate some of your money to them if you would like to support the cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Though, </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nvaccess.org/support-us/%23donation-support&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756005772167471&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Pb6WfEKj1KZ3e5X1DpM9c">here is the donation link</a></span><span class="c2">. And while I don&#39;t have the money to donate, I encourage the people reading or listening to this document to donate to the cause, because it is what a screen reader is supposed to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the point of jaws scripts, yes, to be fair, they have their uses. In fact, brian hartgen, who owns hartgen consultancy, &nbsp;makes a profit off of selling jaws scripts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Here is the website of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.hartgen.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756005772168083&amp;usg=AOvVaw0txFKcR9L08-jv8ZdnMHf-">hartgen consultancy</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;if you would like to check them out. Would recommend them if you are still using jaws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But &nbsp;eitherway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jaws scripts, even, cost. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If i was to be paying for a screen reader which is over $600, i would expect any script to be free. The reason for this is you already paid for the software.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jaws could embed what these scripts have to.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">NVDA has a similar feature called addons, which is also free. Certain addons are paid, but downloading them is usually free.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.q7myxm6gxpms"><span class="c10">My opinion</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First off, the price is outrageusly high. This is downright exploitative, and there is no reason for prices to be this high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t care what justifications you give me, none of them are going to work. They&rsquo;re all bologna. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are a lot of blind people whio don&rsquo;t even have a hundred dollars, and you expect them to pay $600 for a screen reader?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Absolutely not!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a never event. The only exception is if a screen reader is so good that it can read every single image, with absolutely 0 tolerance for failure which i know from experience it cannot do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scripts alone can also be expensive, and i know for a fact FS does not pay people to do scripting. It&rsquo;s like NVDA addons, just smaller and less tolerable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is absolutely no reason for a screen reader to cost almost a thousand dollars a year, point, blank, period!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t care about your justifications, they&rsquo;re all bologna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In edition to this, it also can&rsquo;t read every single web page, it can&rsquo;t read every single application that doesn&rsquo;t have propper screen reader adjustments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This makes it even more not worth $600.00, not even worth a hundred dollars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Again, NVDA is free, and open source. Even they don&rsquo;t charge abnormal amounts for screen reader usage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, it&rsquo;s worth noting, at least not that i could find, jaws *doesn&rsquo;t* have a portible coppy. That means you can&rsquo;t just put it on a flash drive and take it with you. At least on NVDA you can create a portable coppy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This, once again, is not worth my money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The things jaws does, most of them you can do with either NVDA or narrator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No account required to use any such program. Even narrator will work without a microsoft account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is to sustain billion life, not to sustain some employees and the owner. This is for elites and organizations who can avoid it, such as rehab organizations, not people like you and me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They don&rsquo;t have us at hart, they have their bank accounts and maybe even, who knows, billionaire elites at hart.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.v1n6cp5mva0z"><span class="c10">Conclusion</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>I do not recommend getting jaws, or any software like this, because it is very exploitative, and most features can be done using NVDA.</span></p></body></html>
