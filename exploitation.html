In this post, we will explore just one of these holes,and how this relates to the blindness industry.</span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.dxh72lghpl7m"><span class="c8">The facts</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Let&rsquo;s take </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">jaws</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as an example.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">JAWS, Job Access With Speech, is the world&rsquo;s most popular screen reader, developed for computer users whose vision loss prevents them from seeing screen content or navigating with a mouse. JAWS provides speech and Braille output for the most popular computer applications on your PC. You will be able to navigate the Internet, write a document, read an email and create presentations from your office, remote desktop, or from home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This all sounds good, but let&rsquo;s look at the price</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s take a &nbsp;look at their </span><span class="c6 c13"><a class="c7" href="https://store.freedomscientific.com/collections/software-for-home">pricing options</a></span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.nzig6nbmg85o"><span class="c8">Jaws home</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s important to remember that jaws aren&#39;t anything special. It&rsquo;s a screen reader. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we take a look at their home yearly price, yearly alone, it&rsquo;s $623.00 a year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re on a device that isn&rsquo;t reading numbers and needs numbers: that would be six hundred twenty three dollars a year</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s around $51.92 per month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I&#39;ll get to my opinions later, right now I just wanna go with the facts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>So let&rsquo;s compare that to </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1">windows narrator</a></span><span>&nbsp;and &nbsp;</span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://nvaccess.org">NVDA</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s the price for those? O wait, there isn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re both free. NVDA is even open source, if you want an open source option/alternative to narrator, but let&rsquo;s press on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, there is a perpetual license. This would be the preference, but there is a problem we must discuss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the perpetual licensing, it mentions something known as a </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://store.freedomscientific.com/collections/software-for-home/products/jaws-home-edition-screen-reading-software">software maintenance agreement (SMA)</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quoting from the horses mouth:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c11">To ensure the ability to use your computer with the continuous updates of Windows, Office&reg;, your browser, and other applications, your purchase includes a Software Maintenance Agreement (SMA). An SMA ensures you are protected now and in the future, as it includes the next two years of JAWS.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11">SMAs are activated on the date of purchase.</span></p><p class="c0 c15"><span class="c12">SMAs are </span><span class="c12 c17">tracked by term (e.g., 24 months)</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;from activation, no longer tied to a product version.</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A SMA basically forces you to pay more than you already paid for software you already licensed, ahem, sorry, I mean,bought, ahem, sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something in my throat&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem is you already have the software. You paid the onetime fee. And yet they&rsquo;re making it more expensive on you, the user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re probably thinking long term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you are, you might wanna get a perpetual license. But what good is it when you are literally paying for a, let&rsquo;s call it what it is, subscription, that &nbsp;you didn&rsquo;t wanna pay for in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the people I&#39;ve noticed people trying to make is that they have features. They need to sustain themselves. They have scripts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sustaining yourself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First off, I&#39;ve seen businesses sustain themselves, while charging far less money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, I worked in one before. It didn&rsquo;t have much money but maybe a few thousand, and it was still able to sustain itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it did very well, and earned more money each day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for NVDA, NVDA literally delivers it free of charge. They primarily go from donations, and corporate IT help and support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, on the page linked above for nvda, you can literally go to it, and you can donate some of your money to them if you would like to support the cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Though, </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://nvaccess.org/support-us/#donation-support">here is the donation link</a></span><span class="c1">. And while I don&#39;t have the money to donate, I encourage the people reading or listening to this document to donate to the cause, because it is what a screen reader is supposed to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the point of jaws scripts, yes, to be fair, they have their uses. In fact, brian hartgen, who owns hartgen consultancy, &nbsp;makes a profit off of selling jaws scripts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Here is the website of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="http://www.hartgen.org/">hartgen consultancy</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if you would like to check them out. I would recommend them if you are still using jaws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But &nbsp;either way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaws scripts, even, cost. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If i was to be paying for a screen reader which is over $600, i would expect any script to be free. The reason for this is you already paid for the software.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaws could embed what these scripts have to.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">NVDA has a similar feature called addons, which is also free. Certain addons are paid, but downloading them is usually free.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.q7myxm6gxpms"><span class="c8">My opinion</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First off, the price is outrageously high. This is downright exploitative, and there is no reason for prices to be this high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care what justifications you give me, none of them are going to work. They&rsquo;re all bologna. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a lot of blind people who don&rsquo;t even have a hundred dollars, and you expect them to pay $600 for a screen reader?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Absolutely not!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a never event. The only exception is if a screen reader is so good that it can read every single image, with absolutely 0 tolerance for failure which I know from experience it cannot do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Scripts alone can also be expensive, and I know for a fact FS does not pay people to do scripting. It&rsquo;s like NVDA addons, just smaller and less tolerable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is absolutely no reason for a screen reader to cost almost a thousand dollars a year, point, blank, period!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care about your justifications, they&rsquo;re all bologna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to this, it also can&rsquo;t read every single web page, it can&rsquo;t read every single application that doesn&rsquo;t have proper screen reader adjustments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This makes it even more not worth $600.00, not even worth a hundred dollars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, NVDA is free, and open source. Even they don&rsquo;t charge abnormal amounts for screen reader usage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, it&rsquo;s worth noting, at least not that i could find, jaws *doesn&rsquo;t* have a portable copy. That means you can&rsquo;t just put it on a flash drive and take it with you. At least on NVDA you can create a portable copy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This, once again, is not worth my money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The things jaws does, most of them you can do with either NVDA or narrator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No account required to use any such program. Even the narrator will work without a microsoft account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is to sustain a billion lives, not to sustain some employees and the owner. This is for elites and organizations who can avoid it, such as rehab organizations, not people like you and me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don&rsquo;t have us at heart, they have their bank accounts and maybe even, who knows, billionaire elites at heart.</span></p><h6 class="c14" id="h.sr8flbiomhf4"><span class="c9">Update</span></h6><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something i didn&rsquo;t see before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is, emphatically, a jaws annual license home that can be purchased for $104</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Review that page </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://store.freedomscientific.com/collections/software-for-home/products/jaws-home-annual">here</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thanks to </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://allovertheplace.ca/@DavidGoldfield">david goldfield</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for letting me know of this.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://tweesecake.social/@DavidGoldfield@allovertheplace.ca/115081982686903443">Post</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even then, it still feels exploitative to an extent. Even if jaws annual is under $100 they should clearly &nbsp;outline this within the jaws page linked to at the beginning of the page, for US customers. I am in the US myself and am rather disappointed they didn&rsquo;t either redirect me to this page, or just show a heading that says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounds like they are trying to hide this discount intensionally, as i could not find it in the first page i checked. Of course, do let me know if i went wrong on this, or if there&rsquo;s something i&rsquo;ll missing, and as i did just now, i will correct my mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c5" id="h.v1n6cp5mva0z"><span class="c8">Conclusion</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do not recommend getting jaws, or any software like this, because it is very exploitative, and most features can be done using NVDA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://blindsoft.net/blog">return to blog</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://blindsoft.net/">return to main blindsoft website</a></span></p></body></html>
