It can do a lot of fingerprinting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>For example, if we look at </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/self-defense">cover your tracks (EFF)</a></span><span class="c0">, we&rsquo;ll see that browser fingerprinting can be part of javascript. Browser fingerprinting is telling which browser you use, EG, brave, firefox, &nbsp;google chrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not all the problems of javascript. There are even some security problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>For instance, &nbsp;</span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec09/tech/full_papers/barth.pdf">this article</a></span><span>&nbsp;written by Adam Barth, explores exploits in javascript in implementations such as </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit">apples webkit</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;used by safari in apple devices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While we are looking at privacy, not exactly exploitation, it was worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But let&rsquo;s press on&hellip;</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.hdwszrd1s63s"><span class="c2">The KYC requirement</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>If the VPN is supposed to be private, why is KYC </span><span><strong>required</strong></span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, why is it even there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Even if you do use amazon or google wallet, that is still kyc. Yes, vp only has a token and will be linked to your google account, so on one hand , you have a level of security by not giving </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://vp.net">vp.net</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your credit card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t matter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Google still does its own kyc, so does amazon, so you are just trusting another provider with your data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And, of course, add on to the fact each payment option requires personally identifiable information (</span><span>pii</span><span class="c0">) which means if they get breached, either way, your data is at risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a good friend of mine, kevin karhan, once said, &ldquo;KYC is the elicit activity&rdquo;.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.hmyj7yblwrmw"><span class="c2">Host IP address</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>Did I mention that </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://vp.net">vp.net</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have an onion service yet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O, i didn&rsquo;t? Well, I&#39;m mentioning it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verified privacy does not have any onion service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means that they want your actual IP address.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same goes for the client. The client has your actual IP address, if you are not protected via tor on the network level.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.5gkdgrwr29ea"><span class="c2">Speaking of, let&rsquo;s talk about the client</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The client needs your information either way, so your login information/username.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This completely defeats the anonymous gig, as the client requires your username, which can still be correlated back to you. If the NSA&lt; CIA&lt; FBI, or any agency, were to subpoena VP, or even their third parties (they do) then that means your data is now in the hands of someone else you didn&rsquo;t even give permission to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is where we get to the main claim&hellip;</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.klf1a8qtd1bx"><span class="c2">Hardware backed no logging</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a complete scam.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First off, if you are in IT and you&rsquo;ve set up a VPN server before, you will know that the server generates the keys from a protocol, like wireguard or IPSec.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The key is generated on the </span><span><strong>server</strong></span><span>, not the </span><span><strong>client</strong></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the first component we will discuss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The keys are required for encryption.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The key encrypts and decrypts traffic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The administrators of VP have access to the servers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they wanted to, they could go to their log viewer, which is on pretty much any VPN server, and can view the logs solely based on the key for that user.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can include timestamps, the URL, and the user. If VP installs a rogue SSL certificate for decryption, it can also decrypt the contents, though I have no proof this is the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, this is false. They can absolutely log based on the key.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The second part of the claim is that </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/software-guard-extensions.html">intel SGX</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;protects you from this logging by putting it into separate spaces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right off the bat, there is a problem here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In case you don&rsquo;t know what a trusted execution environment is, it is an environment where applications can securely execute inside of a different operating system, not the client OS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In </span><span>intels</span><span>&nbsp;case, TEE is </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html">Intel trusted domain extensions</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which is part of intel software guard extension environments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you&rsquo;re using Android, another example of TEE is the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/trusty">trusty tee</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which is open source.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That brings me to my next problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The TDX and SGX are proprietary black boxes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This means that SGX is no more trustworthy than windows, as both are proprietary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>That trust only degrades if you add in the intel</span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008927/software/chipset-software.html">management engine</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which in the past, was enabled by default, and if i remember correctly, still is today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This means that if the NSA exploits IME, or your adversary exploits it, that means they get access to your entire OS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is also another factor: intel SGX has its own set of vulnerabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Take </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32086">CVE-2025-32086</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as an example</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c7">Improperly implemented security check for standard in the DDRIO configuration for some Intel(R) Xeon(R) 6 Processors when using Intel(R) SGX or Intel(R) TDX may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with the TEE being proprietary, it&rsquo;s not like an open source repository, where someone can easily push a request for a fix, and intel &nbsp;can implement it.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The SGX factor only secures the </span><span><strong>client</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from logs, meaning if the client gets leaked, &nbsp;the VPN logs won&rsquo;t be available in the client.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>To VPs credit, they have published </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://github.com/vpdotnet/vpnetd-sgx">the source code for the TDX enclave</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even then, SGX and TDX are both proprietary. You cannot trust what is running on SGX and TDX themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, as stated before, it only protects the client/host operating system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The server could still see what you&rsquo;re doing</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.h1mi0qdnts94"><span class="c2">The solution to no logging</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For there to be a, true, no logging policy, first off, the VPN needs to be on an onion service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Furthermore, </span><span>monero</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;XMR should be the only thing accepted for currency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for key generating, key generation needs to be on the client only. No server clients, there needs to be only client side key generation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That key needs to stay on the client, with the server not having any power over the key.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alternatively, there could be a public private key pair, where the server has the public key, and the private key would only be on the client.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we need a secure element to store the key which is fair, it could be that, for example, trusty on android could provide a confidential computing source for the key, or a secure element, such as the titan M on google pixel devices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>An even better solution would be to store it on a hardware based key such as </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://nitrokey.com">nitrokey</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A nitrokey HSM would do very well for this purpose. And if you want to do ephemeral key generation using it, you could always utilize the PKCS11 libraries, which should, if done correctly, provide the means to do perfect forward secrecy (PFS).</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because there is nothing to decrypt on the server end, it would protect user internet privacy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Added to the tor component, it will have 2layers of protection, 1 with tor on the network level, and another on the VPN.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And provided you do XMR, this means that the user will be anonymous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a true hardware backed no logging environment.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.jd9688jfv1dt"><span class="c2">Comparing VP to mullvad</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://mullvad.net">Mullvad</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a VPN service as well. Except, it has actual privacy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>For example, it has an </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion">onion service (requires tor to access)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and it allows you to use crypto, like XMR, to purchase mullvad. Furthermore, no KYC, it only &nbsp;uses an account number to verify you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The client sees your IP, but then again, this can be mitigated with tor either at proxy or at the network level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t see VP doing this at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mullvad is actually taking steps for privacy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be frank, I do not recommend mullvad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if I had to go with a VPN solution, this is the one I&#39;d go with.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.ni41ouglr21h"><span class="c2">Conclusion</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">VP is a total sham, and not worth it at all.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.65t33iedwjsi"><span class="c2">Navigation</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://blindsoft.net/blog">return to blog</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://blindsoft.net">return to site</a></span></p></body></html>
