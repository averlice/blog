  <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">My response to criticism to the exploitation of the blind post.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.22dkj46zzbbb"><span class="c5">Contact email</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="mailto:averlicetech@proton.me" target="_blank">averlicetech@proton.me</a></span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.n9zrfyhyk7u2"><span class="c5">Context</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span>Most of you know a recent post I made, which was, emphatically, the first blog post about the</span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://blindsoft.net/blog/exploitation.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;exploitation of the blind</a></span><span class="c1">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A lot of you had something to say, and don&rsquo;t worry, I will go through some of your emails.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Note:</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">No email will be given, and I do not encourage any attack or docs on these people.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.pafeamgqr79e"><span class="c5">The discount problem.</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s start with the problem most of you were upset about, the problem where I forgot to post a discount.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before I get into it, let me just say this does not change my opinion, not one bit. But I just wanted to add it in there, because at the same time, it has to be fair.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">David Goldfield was the first to point this out.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span>This is the </span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://tweesecake.social/@DavidGoldfield@allovertheplace.ca/115081982686903443" target="_blank">post</a></span>
    <span class="c1">&nbsp;on 8-24-2025.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is something I did not see initially.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span>The page he was referring to was </span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://store.freedomscientific.com/collections/software-for-home/products/jaws-home-annual" target="_blank">this page</a></span>
    <span class="c1">&nbsp;as opposed to the normal page, where on this one you can get jaws for just $104.00 a year.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I have since corrected this a few minutes after the report was made to me.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span>You would&rsquo;ve known this if you would&rsquo;ve checked the github repository </span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://github.com/averlice/blog" target="_blank">here</a></span>
    <span class="c1">&nbsp;or the discord server which had the commit message on the date of fix or if you would&rsquo;ve just, i don&rsquo;t know, read the entire thing.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I say this because that is also when I added my contact information for questions, comments and concerns.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now I apologize for this mistake, and I acknowledge I messed up a bit in my reporting.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some of you, like David Goldfield, were kind enough to report this without being blunt about it, and I appreciate it.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If this had not already been fixed, I would&#39;ve found your criticism fair.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">David Goldfield caught the error, so it was fair to comment on it.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, I shall address some of your emails.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.gn040vn1lt4x"><span class="c5">I don&rsquo;t care who I offend.</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re absolutely right. I&#39;m not a people pleaser and I, frankly, don&rsquo;t care.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">this isn&rsquo;t to butter up your feelings or your ego&rsquo;s.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is an opinion piece of mine.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This &nbsp;report is not meant to be based on how you feel.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t have access to your brain, I don&#39;t know (or &nbsp;care) how you feel. This is to not only provide my opinion, but also information on why jaws are exploitative.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.d6haz0bsqt90"><span class="c5">Nvaccess</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some even said if NVDA did the same thing, I would be ok with it.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span>There&rsquo;s a difference between corporate IT support, which </span><span>nvaccess</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;does have, and home users.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I know for a fact NVAccess, even if they did go premium, is not going to charge you $600 or $100 just to use the screen reading software.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a large difference between $10.00 a month or $50.00 a year, and $600 a year.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">People can pay $10, at least most people.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And if they did make you pay that much money, I would be calling them out too.</span></p>
  <p class="c2 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.ihz5t59mnd9f"><span class="c5">I have an agenda</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Funny of you to say, considering I&#39;m just a guy. I&rsquo;m not being paid to do any of this research or I&#39;m not even paid by NVDA.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m just a guy sitting behind a screen typing his opinions.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.334oah1trnxd"><span class="c5">Someone disappointed in jaws</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not the only one. I got an email from someone in Ukraine, who claims they even have to get cracked versions of jaws to use it.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not the only one with problems around here.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.uhtjv8wmxo3y"><span class="c5">Why my opinion has not changed</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is still exploitative to not &nbsp;send US IP addresses to this custom discount.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fact they can&rsquo;t do so is quite suspicious. And VPNs? Don&rsquo;t give me that. Be grateful.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is very possible in various ways.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I know for a fact FS uses cloudflare, which just so happens to have redirect options via a redirect rule.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So this is very possible via the CDN side.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">They just refuse to so they can exploit their customers who don&rsquo;t know any better.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Remember, I&#39;m trying to research as the guy who&rsquo;s trying to use a computer. Not from an IT standpoint but the mom and son standpoint where the person is trying to configure a computer for their child to use. Or could be a different case, where someone is trying to configure a computer for a blind friend to use, but thinks jaws might be best suited.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jaws should automatically see the IP address, which it can, and redirect them to the discount.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is no reason why this isn&rsquo;t possible. In fact, it&rsquo;s very possible.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How do we know?</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Back when Kaspersky was around, if it saw your IP coming from the US , it&rsquo;d automatically redirect you to the USA website where you can get US pricing, and products.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if this were solved, the perpetual licensing is also outright exploitative.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There should be no reason at all to charge yearly fees just for a so-called SLA or whatever it&rsquo;s called.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">No reason!</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.tt6crorwijj8"><span class="c5">Arguments</span></h1>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.wk75pa4wvgi3"><span class="c5">They need to sustain themselves</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask a mom and pop gas station if they charge customers $800 per gallon for gas. We&rsquo;re talking per gallon, per customer.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask them also if they charge thousands of dollars so you can buy a bag of chips. No!</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">They don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I worked in a small family gas station somewhere, and they made little money. But guess what? They sustained.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shocking right??</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">They survived.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">They made good money, but not as good as FS executives and billionaire elitists are making. And still survived.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span>As hank williams jr once said, &ldquo;</span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cQNkIrg-Tk" target="_blank">a country boy can survive"</a></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So don&rsquo;t fool me with that.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c0" id="h.ffybglpe6xfd"><span class="c5">(perpetual) They&rsquo;re charging you for upgrades</span></h1>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unexceptible! I paid for the software, be grateful. After all we&rsquo;re just trying to sustain ourselves right? No billionaire elitist stuff going on right? This doesn&rsquo;t look like we&rsquo;re just trying to sustain ourselves.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Doesn&rsquo;t look like it at all.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c1">All it looks to me is a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.</span></p>
